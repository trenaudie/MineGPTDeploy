Wundt founded the first psychology laboratory at the University of Leipzig in 1879, and his work focused on introspection and the study of conscious experience. He believed that psychology should be a science, and that the study of consciousness could be approached through systematic observation and experimentation. Wundt's ideas were influential in the development of structuralism, a school of psychology that focused on the analysis of the basic elements of consciousness.\\n\\nAnother early school of psychology was functionalism, which emphasized the study of the purpose and function of behavior. Functionalists believed that behavior was shaped by its consequences, and that the study of behavior should focus on its adaptive value. This approach was influenced by the work of Charles Darwin, who proposed that behavior evolved through natural selection.\\n\\nThe early 20th century saw the rise of behaviorism, a school of psychology that rejected the study of consciousness and focused instead on observable behavior. Behaviorists believed that behavior was shaped by the environment, and that the study of behavior should focus on the relationship between stimuli and responses. This approach was influential in the development of behavior therapy, a form of psychotherapy that focuses on changing behavior through reinforcement and punishment.\\n\\nIn the mid-20th century, cognitive psychology emerged as a new school of psychology that focused on the study of mental processes such as perception, memory, and thinking. Cognitive psychologists believed that behavior was shaped by internal mental processes, and that the study of behavior should focus on the relationship between stimuli, mental processes, and responses. This approach was influential in the development of cognitive-behavioral therapy, a form of psychotherapy that focuses on changing behavior by changing the way people think about and interpret their experiences.\\n\\nToday, psychology is a diverse and multifaceted field that encompasses a wide range of approaches and perspectives. Psychologists continue to study the mind and behavior, and to apply their knowledge to a variety of practical problems and social issues.\",\n",

Psychology includes the study of conscious and unconscious phenomena, including feelings and thoughts. It is an academic discipline of immense scope, crossing the boundaries between the natural and social sciences. Psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, linking the discipline to neuroscience. As social scientists, psychologists aim to understand the behavior of individuals and groups.[1][2] Ψ (psi), the first letter of the Greek word psyche from which the term psychology is derived (see below), is commonly associated with the science.\\n\\nA professional practitioner or researcher involved in the discipline is called a psychologist. Some psychologists can also be classified as behavioral or cognitive scientists. Some psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior. Others explore the physiological and neurobiological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors.\\n\\nPsychologists are involved in research on perception, cognition, attention, emotion, intelligence, subjective experiences, motivation, brain functioning, and personality. Psychologists\\' interests extend to interpersonal relationships, psychological resilience, family resilience, and other areas within social psychology. They also consider the unconscious mind.[3] Research psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. Some, but not all, clinical and counseling psychologists rely on symbolic interpretation.\\n\\nWhile psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity. By many accounts, psychology ultimately aims to benefit society.[4][5][6] Many psychologists are involved in some kind of therapeutic role, practicing psychotherapy in clinical, counseling, or school settings. Other psychologists conduct scientific research on a wide range of topics related to mental processes and behavior. Typically the latter group of psychologists work in academic settings (e.g., universities, medical schools, or hospitals). Another group of psychologists is employed in industrial and organizational settings.[7] Yet others are involved in work on human development, aging, sports, health, forensic science, education, and the media.\\n\\nEtymology and definitions\\nThe word psychology derives from the Greek word psyche, for spirit or soul. The latter part of the word \"psychology\" derives from -λογία -logia, which refers to \"study\" or \"research\".[8] The Latin word psychologia was first used by the Croatian humanist and Latinist Marko Marulić in his book, Psichiologia de ratione animae humanae (Psychology, on the Nature of the Human Soul) in the late 15th century or early 16th century.[9] The earliest known reference to the word psychology in English was by Steven Blankaart in 1694 in The Physical Dictionary. The dictionary refers to \"Anatomy, which treats the Body, and Psychology, which treats of the Soul.\"[10]\\n\\nIn 1890, William James defined psychology as \"the science of mental life, both of its phenomena and their conditions.\"[11] This definition enjoyed widespread currency for decades. However, this meaning was contested, notably by radical behaviorists such as John B. Watson, who in 1913 asserted that the discipline is a \"natural science\", the theoretical goal of which \"is the prediction and control of behavior.\"[12] Since James defined \"psychology\", the term more strongly implicates scientific experimentation.[13][12] Folk psychology refers to ordinary people\\'s, as contrasted with psychology professionals\\', understanding of the mental states and behaviors of people.[14]\\n\\nHistory\\nMain article: History of psychology\\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of psychology.\\nThe ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, China, India, and Persia all engaged in the philosophical study of psychology. In Ancient Egypt the Ebers Papyrus mentioned depression and thought disorders.[15] Historians note that Greek philosophers, including Thales, Plato, and Aristotle (especially in his De Anima treatise),[16] addressed the workings of the mind.[17] As early as the 4th century BC, the Greek physician Hippocrates theorized that mental disorders had physical rather than supernatural causes.[18] In 387 BCE, Plato suggested that the brain is where mental processes take place, and in 335 BCE Aristotle suggested that it was the heart.[19]\\n\\nIn China, psychological understanding grew from the philosophical works of Laozi and Confucius, and later from the doctrines of Buddhism. This body of knowledge involves insights drawn from introspection and observation, as well as techniques for focused thinking and acting. It frames the universe in term of a division of physical reality and mental reality as well as the interaction between the physical and the mental. Chinese philosophy also emphasized purifying the mind in order to increase virtue and power. An ancient text known as The Yellow Emperor\\'s Classic of Internal Medicine identifies the brain as the nexus of wisdom and sensation, includes theories of personality based on yin–yang balance, and analyzes mental disorder in terms of physiological and social disequilibria. Chinese scholarship that focused on the brain advanced during the Qing Dynasty with the work of Western-educated Fang Yizhi (1611–1671), Liu Zhi (1660–1730), and Wang Qingren (1768–1831). Wang Qingren emphasized the importance of the brain as the center of the nervous system, linked mental disorder with brain diseases, investigated the causes of dreams and insomnia, and advanced a theory of hemispheric lateralization in brain function.[20]\\n\\nInfluenced by Hinduism, Indian philosophy explored distinctions in types of awareness. A central idea of the Upanishads and other Vedic texts that formed the foundations of Hinduism was the distinction between a person\\'s transient mundane self and their eternal, unchanging soul. Divergent Hindu doctrines and Buddhism have challenged this hierarchy of selves, but have all emphasized the importance of reaching higher awareness. Yoga encompasses a range of techniques used in pursuit of this goal. Theosophy, a religion established by Russian-American philosopher Helena Blavatsky, drew inspiration from these doctrines during her time in British India.[21][22]\\n\\nPsychology was of interest to Enlightenment thinkers in Europe. In Germany, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716) applied his principles of calculus to the mind, arguing that mental activity took place on an indivisible continuum. He suggested that the difference between conscious and unconscious awareness is only a matter of degree. Christian Wolff identified psychology as its own science, writing Psychologia Empirica in 1732 and Psychologia Rationalis in 1734. Immanuel Kant advanced the idea of anthropology as a discipline, with psychology an important subdivision. Kant, however, explicitly rejected the idea of an experimental psychology, writing that \"the empirical doctrine of the soul can also never approach chemistry even as a systematic art of analysis or experimental doctrine, for in it the manifold of inner observation can be separated only by mere division in thought, and cannot then be held separate and recombined at will (but still less does another thinking subject suffer himself to be experimented upon to suit our purpose), and even observation by itself already changes and displaces the state of the observed object.\" In 1783, Ferdinand Ueberwasser (1752–1812) designated himself Professor of Empirical Psychology and Logic and gave lectures on scientific psychology, though these developments were soon overshadowed by the Napoleonic Wars.[23] At the end of the Napoleonic era, Prussian authorities discontinued the Old University of Münster.[23] Having consulted philosophers Hegel and Herbart, however, in 1825 the Prussian state established psychology as a mandatory discipline in its rapidly expanding and highly influential educational system. However, this discipline did not yet embrace experimentation.[24] In England, early psychology involved phrenology and the response to social problems including alcoholism, violence, and the country\\'s crowded \"lunatic\" asylums.[25]\\nOutlineHistorySubfields\\nBasic types\\nAbnormalBehavioralBehavioral geneticsBiologicalCognitive/CognitivismComparativeCross-culturalCulturalDevelopmentalDifferentialEvolutionaryExperimentalMathematicalNeuropsychologyPersonalityPositivePsychodynamicPsychometricsQuantitativeSocial\\nApplied psychology\\nApplied behavior analysisClinicalCommunityConsumerCounselingCriticalEducationalEnvironmentalErgonomicsFoodForensicHealthHumanisticIndustrial and organizationalLegalMedicalMilitaryMusicOccupational healthPoliticalPsychometricsReligionSchoolSportTraffic\\nLists\\nDisciplinesOrganizationsPsychologistsPsychotherapiesResearch methodsTheoriesTimelineTopics\\n Psychology portal\\nvte\\nPsychology is the scientific study of mind and behavior in humans and non-humans.
